== Description ==

Notice: 

Before you install and use this plugin, please read the following notices carefully.

- This plugin only caches homepage, posts and pages.
- Logged-in users will not trigger the caching processes.
- The cached data outputs at a very eary stage of WordPress, the `init` action hook, so that the admin bar will disappear when browsing homepage, posts and pages, even you are logged in.
- This plugin is designed for performance, not for convenience.
- A debug message will be attached to the end of the page source code. `<!-- This page is cached by Cache Master plugin. //-->`. This is for debugging purpose only, to let us know that the page is caching.
